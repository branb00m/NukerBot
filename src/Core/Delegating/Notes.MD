# Delegation Instances (Now called D.N.I) (Delegated Network Instances)

These are your bot's best friend. They're like mutated allied schizophrenia. These instances show up to provide allied support.

Another equivalent is Big Brother. These bot instances can be delegated and carried out to do multiple tasks. They're called Little Brothers E.G: Channel nuking on an entirely separate endpoint.

These instances can be delegated from the main bot instance to complete certain tasks and perhaps handle them more efficiently and effectively.
